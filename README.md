This stack contains all the source code and utility programs used in creating the firmware for my Mecanum Bot.

For the avr project you will need to pull in the arduino-cmake files. Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` in the stack directory (the directory where this README file is located).

To generate Eclipse project files, run `make-eclipse-project.sh` in the stack directory.
